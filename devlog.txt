    Finished a basic implementation of OAuth for Spotify
    - Running app.py will display a single link to log in to Spotify
    - After a callback, the user's access token, raw profile data and raw saved tracks data will be displayed
    - Added comments to all changes made in the files (app.py, utils/sift.py)
