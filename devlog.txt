	Finished a basic implementation of OAuth for Spotify
	- Running app.py will display a single link to log in to Spotify
	- After a callback, the user's access token, raw profile data and raw saved tracks data will be displayed
	- Added comments to all changes made in the files (app.py, utils/sift.py)
	- Will need to implement the 'state' parameter in the initial request
	- Still need to figure out how to implement the 'refresh_token'

       Mostly finished sift.py
       - parse_json( tracks_raw_dict ) takes json in raw form of tracks and converts it to a normal dict
       - get_saved_tracks(access_token) returns parsed tracks_dict with all of the user's library, instead of latest 50 songs
       - ^^ not perfect though, not sure how to stop once actual library size is met (right now, hardcoded at 1000)
       - After logging in to Spotify, dashboard now displays list of tuples
       - each tuple has the artist name and the number of songs saved from that artist
       - tuples are in order from greatest number of songs to least
       - list of tuples is top n artists (n can be changed in app.py's calling of get_top_n_artists)
       - note: list of tuples instead of dictionary
       - another issue: not quite sure how to get artist's pfp from spotify, but this shouldn't be too hard and can be added easily to the tuple
       - BUG: not sure why, but for some of the artists the number of songs is far less than what it should be...
       - Related ^^: artists are separated (i.e., if you have a song by Disclosure and Eliza Doolittle, the artists will be in the list separately
       - To Do (other than fix these bugs): separate out authorization stuff from sift.py
